# python_all_in_one_exercises
Exercices from python all in one for dummies book. 

Includes basic, numpy, pandas, Machine Learning exercices and so on.

The Pandas analysis example uses the "diamonds" [database](https://www.kaggle.com/shivam2503/diamonds) from kaggle.

This code is based on the book "Python all in one for dummies". Great book. I recomend purchasing it.
